C. S.M.A.R.T tasks and Timeline breakdown:

S.M.A.R.T tasks:

S. Specific:
Create a creepy and fun experience for PC gamers by planning and 
focusing on world creation, ambience, themes, and smooth 2D visuals. 

M. Measurable:
Create a creepy and fun experience for PC gamers by planning and 
focusing on world creation, ambience, themes, and smooth 2D visuals. 
The idea would be to make the experience with a "more is less" feel, a
smaller world, but the visuals and dynamic feel would be a focus.

A. Achievable:
Create a creepy and fun experience for PC gamers by planning and 
focusing on world creation, ambience, themes, and smooth 2D visuals. 
The idea would be to have a "more is less" feel, a small world, but 
the visuals and quick fighting are the priorities.

R. Relevant:
Create a creepy and fun experience for PC gamers by planning and 
focusing on world creation, ambience, themes, and smooth 2D visuals. 
The idea would be to have a "more is less" feel, a small world, but 
the visuals and quick fighting are the priorities. This is because 
"more is less" is a very effective method of selling an experience that 
would work well for us with our limitted time.

T. Time-bound:
Create a creepy and fun experience for PC gamers by December 2023. We would make this work 
by planning and focusing on world creation, ambience, and quick fights. 
The idea would be to have a "more is less" feel, a small world, but 
the visuals and quick fighting are the priorities. This is because 
"more is less" is a very effective method of selling an experience that 
would work well for us with our limited time.
